The `analyze_problem()` method uses the `solve_encyption()` function to decrypt the problem and get the original problem, which is then stored in the `original_problem` attribute of the class. The `generate_plan()` method is incomplete and needs to be filled with real plans based on the original problem. The `generate_solution()` method is also incomplete and needs to be filled with real solutions for each sub-task based on the original problem. The `solve_encyption()` function converts the encrypted problem to a tree using the `string_to_tree()` function, then performs inorder traversal to collect the words in the problem, and finally constructs the original problem by concatenating the words.\n't\n't\n"], "eval_results": [false]}
